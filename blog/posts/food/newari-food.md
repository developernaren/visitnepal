# Newari Food

It's combination of veg and mostly non-veg food. Most consumed animal is water buffalo and we basically eat all the parts including brains, tongue, blood,bone marrow, intestine etc. For veg people, you have lentil pancakes, beaten rice, curd, potatoes, soybeans, bamboo shoots, and many more.
