# Our Time in Nepal

### Calendar

Nepal uses a different calendar for its festivals and events. Below is the calendar. The month of our tour is during October to November.
This is Kartik in Nepal meaning there are two big festival happening, Tihar (knowm in India as Diwali) and Chhath.
If you are into seeing these things I can make some recommendations for where to go.
