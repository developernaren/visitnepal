# Our Time in Nepal

## Our Schedule

### Trek
We will start our trek on October 26th. The trek will most likely take 4 days. We will spend 1 day in Pokhara and visit around. We can decide on when to stay in Pokhara. But trekking for 4 days will make you very tired, and we might need to rest for sore legs. So you may not be up for partying. So, visiting places makes sense in the start of the tour

### Before the Trek

Tihar (Diwlai in India) starts from 19th October and ends on 23rd October. If you are interested in tradition and culture in a Nepali society. I recommend you can come during this week. One downside is during last 3 days of the festivals, almost all the restaurants and shops are closed. So, you might have to plan for food accordingly, you will have less options but wont't go hungry do not worry.

### After the Trek

Trekking is hard and if you are not used to it, you will be very tired. So, you might need to spend some days resting.

### Things to do during your time

#### Kartik Natch

This is a traditional dance performed by the Newar community in Nepal. The dance is being performed since 1400 AD. I do not find it very interesting because I have seen it countless times but the atmosphere around the place is really nice. Video for reference and a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartik_Naach).

#### Kukur Tihar

Dogs are worshipped on this day. You do not have to go to a place but all people worship their dogs and people that do not have dogs just worship the stray dogs. You will just see happy dogs with garlands on their necks. It is a nice thing to see.

### Calendar

Nepal uses a different calendar for its festivals and events. Below is the calendar. The month of our tour is during October to November. This is Kartik in Nepal meaning there are two big festival happening, Tihar (knowm in India as Diwali) and Chhath. If you are into seeing these things I can make some recommendations for where to go.
