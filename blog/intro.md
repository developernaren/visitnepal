# Before you start

Things to consider before you embark on your journey to Nepal.

### Visa Requirements

This is the official page for visa requirements for Nepal. Please check this page for the most up-to-date information.
https://immigration.gov.np/en/page/tourist-visa  

Tl:dr; Most countries can get a visa on arrival at the airport. Just remember to bring some USD cash with you.

### On your way to Nepal

Nepal does not have a direct flight from Europe, so you have to transfer from somewhere. [Dubai](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/transit-visa) and [Qatar](https://visitqatar.com/intl-en/plan-your-trip/visas/visa-details) offers  which will allow you to visit Dubai or Doha for few days. You can make a mini vacation out of it.

### Safety and Security

Emergency number in Nepal is ==100== for police and ==102== for ambulance. Please remember these numbers. The main cities we will be travelling during our trip is Kathmandu and Pokhara. These cities are considered very safe for tourists.

#### Walking Alone

During the day, it's very safe to walk around in Nepal. People are very friendly and helpful. Almost everyone can understand and reply to your basic questions in English.
As safe as Nepal is, I would not recommend walking alone at night. Kathmandu is a very old city and the streets are very narrow. It's very easy to get lost. Please use a taxi or a riding app to get around at night.
Also, there are a lot of stray dogs. They come out night and are usually aggressive towards strangers. They are not as friendly during night as they typically seem during the day.

#### Partying

Drinking socially is acceptable in Nepal. There are a lot of bars and clubs in Kathmandu and Pokhara. Please do not get too drunk and walk around alone at night. Please use a taxi or a riding app to get back to your hotel. All the cool bars, pubs and hotels are in [Thamel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fUAiJoge9xK7Wx2m6) if  you are in Kathmandu and [Lakeside](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CeGWbqqU1D5VLWgM6) if you are in Pokhara. So, you can plan your stay based on your what you like.

### General Noise and disturbance

People like to pray and worship early in the morning, so it might disturb your sleep. Depending on your location, stray dogs may bark at night and cause disturbances. Please bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper.

### General Cost of things

Flight to Nepal is pretty expensive but once you land here, things are pretty cheap in Nepal compared to Europe.

A typical meal in a good restaurant will cost you around 5-10 USD per person. 
A bottle of water is 10 cents. 
A beer is 2-3 USD. 
A taxi ride is unexpected. I do not recommend using direct taxis in Nepal. [Check here](##how-to-get-around)
A night in a good hotel is 50-100 USD, you can get cheaper options for 20-30 USD.

### How to get around

#### Riding Apps

You can use [Pathoa](https://pathao.com/np/pathao-app/), [Indrive](https://indrive.com/en-np) or [Tootle](https://www.tootle.com.np/) for getting around in Kathmandu. You can either book a taxi or motorbike.

#### Public Transportation

You need to be very brave to ride public transportation in Nepal. It's very crowded and not very clean; but it's very cheap. A bus ride will cost you 20 cents. If you want to get a sense of how people live in Nepal, you should try it. If you do not like chaos, avoid it.

### Weather

The time we will be in Nepal is most likely October and November. This is the best time to visit Nepal as the weather is clear and the skies are blue. The temperature is also moderate. Air might be polluted because it does not rain as much during these months and there's dust in air. 
Please bring a quality mask if you have allergies or just feel uncomfortable with the air quality.

### Medication

Please bring any medication you might need. You can buy most medication in Nepal but it's always better to have your own.

### Hygiene and Food Poisoning

Please be careful with what you eat and drink. The food in Nepal is very different from what you might be used to. Please drink only bottled water, it costs 10 cents. Please carry medicine for food poisoning.
Please try out new foods and drinks in moderation. Always carry a hand sanitizer with you.

### Toilets

Most toilets in Nepal outside of hotels and cities are squat toilets. Please be prepared for this. There might not be toilet papers in public toilets, so please carry toilet paper or wet wipes if you are travelling outside the city.

### Altitude Sickness

Because we will be travelling to higher altitudes, please take is slow. There are medications available for it, that means you will pee a lot. So, take that into account.

### Trekking and Travel Gear

You can find almost anything you would need for trekking in Kathmandu and for cheap. So, if you do not have trekking gears, worry not! You have to set aside some days for shopping though.

### Fitness and Health

Please be prepared for a lot of walking. During the trek, we may have to walk anywhere from 3 hours a day up to 8 hours day and mostly uphill. Please start excersizing and walking a few months before the trip. Slow and steady is the key here. You have to build up your stamina.
