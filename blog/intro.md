# Before you start

Things to consider before you embark on your journey to Nepal.

### Visa Requirements

This is the official page for visa requirements for Nepal. Please check this page for the most up-to-date information.
https://immigration.gov.np/en/page/tourist-visa  

Tl:dr; Most countries can get a visa on arrival at the airport. Just remember to bring some USD cash with you.


### Weather

The time we will be in Nepal is most likely October and November. This is the best time to visit Nepal as the weather is clear and the skies are blue. The temperature is also moderate. Air might be polluted because it does not rain as much during these months and there's dust in air. 
Please bring a quality mask if you have allergies or just feel uncomfortable with the air quality.

### Medication

Please bring any medication you might need. You can buy most medication in Nepal but it's always better to have your own.

### Hygiene and Food Poisoning

Please be careful with what you eat and drink. The food in Nepal is very different from what you might be used to. Please drink only bottled water, it costs 10 cents. Please carry medicine for food poisoning.
Please try out new foods and drinks in moderation. Always carry a hand sanitizer with you.

### Toilets

Most toilets in Nepal outside of hotels and cities are squat toilets. Please be prepared for this.

### Altitude Sickness

Because we will be travelling to higher altitudes, please take is slow. There are medications available for it, that means you will pee a lot. So, take that into account.
