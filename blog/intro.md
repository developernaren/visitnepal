# Before you start

Things to consider before you embark on your journey to Nepal.

### Visa Requirements

This is the official page for visa requirements for Nepal. Please check this page for the most up-to-date information.
https://immigration.gov.np/en/page/tourist-visa  

Tl:dr; Most countries can get a visa on arrival at the airport. Just remember to bring some USD cash with you.

### General Cost of things

Flight to Nepal is pretty expensive but once you land here, things are pretty cheap in Nepal compared to Europe.

A typical meal in a good restaurant will cost you around 5-10 USD per person. 
A bottle of water is 10 cents. 
A beer is 2-3 USD. 
A taxi ride is unexpected. I do not recommend using direct taxis in Nepal. [Check here](##how-to-get-around)
A night in a good hotel is 50-100 USD, you can get cheaper options for 20-30 USD.

### How to get around

#### Riding Apps

You can use [Pathoa](https://pathao.com/np/pathao-app/), [Indrive](https://indrive.com/en-np) or [Tootle](https://www.tootle.com.np/) for getting around in Kathmandu. You can either book a taxi or motorbike.

#### Public Transportation

You need to be very brave to ride public transportation in Nepal. It's very crowded and not very clean; but it's very cheap. A bus ride will cost you 20 cents. If you want to get a sense of how people live in Nepal, you should try it. If you do not like chaos, avoid it.

### Weather

The time we will be in Nepal is most likely October and November. This is the best time to visit Nepal as the weather is clear and the skies are blue. The temperature is also moderate. Air might be polluted because it does not rain as much during these months and there's dust in air. 
Please bring a quality mask if you have allergies or just feel uncomfortable with the air quality.

### Medication

Please bring any medication you might need. You can buy most medication in Nepal but it's always better to have your own.

### Hygiene and Food Poisoning

Please be careful with what you eat and drink. The food in Nepal is very different from what you might be used to. Please drink only bottled water, it costs 10 cents. Please carry medicine for food poisoning.
Please try out new foods and drinks in moderation. Always carry a hand sanitizer with you.

### Toilets

Most toilets in Nepal outside of hotels and cities are squat toilets. Please be prepared for this.

### Altitude Sickness

Because we will be travelling to higher altitudes, please take is slow. There are medications available for it, that means you will pee a lot. So, take that into account.
